readme: "# Bazel rules for TypeScript\n\nThis is the canonical ruleset for using Bazel for TypeScript, based on\n<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js>, and recommended for all new projects.\n\nThis is a high-performance alternative to the `@bazel/typescript` npm package from rules_nodejs.\nThe `ts_project` rule here is identical to the one in rules_nodejs, making it easy to migrate.\nSince rules_js always runs tools from the bazel-out tree, rules_ts naturally fixes most usability bugs with rules_nodejs:\n\n-   Freely mix generated `*.ts` and `tsconfig.json` files in the bazel-out tree with source files\n-   Fixes the need for any `rootDirs` settings in `tsconfig.json` as reported in https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37378\n-   \"worker mode\" for `ts_project` now shares workers across all targets, rather than requiring one worker pool per target\n\nrules_ts is just a part of what Aspect provides:\n\n-   _Need help?_ This ruleset has support provided by https://aspect.dev.\n-   See our other Bazel rules, especially those built for rules_js, linked from <https://github.com/aspect-build>\n\nKnown issues:\n\n-   Does not work with `--worker_sandboxing`. See https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/issues/127#issuecomment-1312041592\n-   Workers are disabled and not currently supported on Windows hosts. See https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/issues/228.\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the release you wish to use:\n<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/releases>\ncopy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.\n\n## Examples\n\nThere are a number of examples in [the examples/ folder](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/tree/main/examples).\n\nIf you'd like an example added, you can file a [Feature Request](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the API documentation in [the docs/ folder](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/tree/main/docs).\n\n### From a BUILD file\n\nThe most common use is with the [`ts_project` macro](./docs/rules.md#ts_project) which invokes the\n[`tsc` CLI](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) to transform\nsource files like `.ts` files into outputs such as `.js` and `.d.ts` files.\n\nWe encourage you to read about the `transpiler` property which lets you use a faster tool like\nBabel or SWC to produce the `.js` files, so you don't have to wait for type-checking in your fast\ndevelopment loop.\n\n### In a macro\n\nMany organizations set default values, so it's common to write a [macro] to wrap `ts_project`, then\nensure that your developers load your macro rather than loading from `@aspect_rules_ts` directly.\n\n[macro]: https://bazel.build/extending/macros\n\n### BUILD file generation\n\nAspect provides an alpha preview of our TypeScript BUILD file generator as part of the\n[Aspect CLI](https://aspect.build/cli). Run `aspect configure` to create or update BUILD.bazel files\nas you edit TypeScript sources.\n\n### Advanced: custom rules\n\nIf you know how to write Bazel rules, you might find that `ts_project` doesn't do what you want.\n\nOne way to customize it is to peel off one layer of indirection, by calling the `ts_project_rule`\ndirectly. This bypasses our default setting logic, and also the validation program which checks that\nts_project attributes are well-formed.\n\nYou can also write a custom rule from scratch. We expose helper functions from /ts/private in this\nrepo. Be aware that these are not a public API, so you may have to account for breaking changes\nwhich aren't subject to our usual semver policy.\n"
